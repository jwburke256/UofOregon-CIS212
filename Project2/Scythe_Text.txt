Arc of Scythe Book 1:
We must, by law, keep a record of the innocents we kill.
And  as  I  see  it,  they’re  all  innocents.  Even  the  guilty.  
Everyone  is  guilty  of  something,  and  everyone  still  har-
bors a memory of childhood innocence, no matter how 
many layers of life wrap around it. Humanity is innocent; 
humanity is guilty, and both states are undeniably true.
We must, by law, keep a record.
It  begins  on  day  one  of  apprenticeship  –  but  we  do  
not officially call it “killing.” It’s not socially or morally cor-
rect to call it such. It is, and has always been, “gleaning,” 
named for the way the poor would trail behind farmers 
in ancient times, taking the stray stalks of grain left behind. 
It was the earliest form of charity. A scythe’s work is the 
same.  Every  child  is  told  from  the  day  he  or  she  is  old  
enough to understand that the scythes provide a crucial 
service for society. Ours is the closest thing to a sacred 
mission the modern world knows.
Perhaps  that  is  why  we  must,  by  law,  keep  a  record.   
A  public  journal,  testifying  to  those  who  will  never  die  
and those who are yet to be born, as to why we human 
beings do the things we do. We are instructed to write 
down not just our deeds but our feelings, because it must 
be  known  that  we  do  have  feelings.  Remorse.  Regret.  
Sorrow too great to bear. Because if we didn’t feel those 
things, what monsters would we be?
